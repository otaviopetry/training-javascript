### **Exercise 2** -> classic fizzBuzz

Print a sequence of _n_ numbers, but when the number:

- is evenly divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'
- is evenly divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'
- is evenly disible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'

### **Exercise 3** -> array sum

Write a function that returns the sum of an array of integers.

### **Exercise 4** -> minimum and maximum sums (HackerRank)

For an array of _n_ integers, write a function that returns the smallest and the greatest sums possible using _n-1_ integers of the array.

### **Exercise 5** -> diagonal difference (HackerRank)

Write a function that calculates the sums of the diagonals of any matrix given and returns the absolute difference between them.

### **Exercise 6** -> staircase/christmas tree (HackerRank)

Write a function that prints a staircase made of spaces and hashes # with _n_ steps.

As a bonus, I've converted it to a christmas tree ðŸŽ„

### **Exercise 7** -> sellings ranking simulator

Write a function to compare two arrays of values:

- 1st array contains the number of sellings of all sellers // i.e [20, 30, 16, 32, 16]
- 2nd array contains simulated sellings of an user // i.e [35, 20, 25]
- If two users made the same number of sellings, they have the same ranking

The function may return the general ranking of the user for each simulated value // i.e [1, 3, 3]

### **Exercise 8** -> tallest candles (HackerRank)

Given an array of integers, get the number of occurrences of the largest number.

### **Exercise 9** -> convert hour string to 24h format

Given an input in 12h format like ```11:05:32PM```, convert it to 24h: ```23:05:32```.

Note that you must remove the AM/PM indicators.

Note also that 12 AM is 00:00:00.

### **Exercise 10** -> round grades (HackerRank)

Round students grades according to the rules:

- If the difference between the *grade* and the next multiple of *5* is less than *3*, round up to the next multiple of *5*
- If the value of *grade* is less than *38*, no rounding occurs as the result is a failing grade

### **Exercise 11** -> migratory birds (HackerRank)

Given an array containing detected migrating birds species IDs, find the higher occurrence bird ID. If two or more species occur the same, return the one with lower ID number.
