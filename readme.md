For an array of _n_ integers, write a function that returns the smallest and the greatest sums possible using _n-1_ integers of the array.

### **Exercise 5** -> diagonal difference

Write a function that calculates the sums of the diagonals of any matrix given and returns the absolute difference between them.

### **Exercise 6** -> staircase/christmas tree

Write a function that prints a staircase made of spaces and hashes # with _n_ steps.

### **Exercise 7** -> sellings ranking simulator

Write a function to compare two arrays of values:

- 1st array contains the number of sellings of all sellers // i.e [20, 30, 16, 32, 16]
- 2nd array contains simulated sellings of an user // i.e [35, 20, 25]
- If two users made the same number of sellings, they have the same ranking

The function may return the general ranking of the user for each simulated value // i.e [1, 3, 3]

### **Exercise 8** -> tallest candles

Given an array of integers, get the number of occurrences of the largest number.

### **Exercise 9** -> convert hour string to 24h format

Given an input in 12h format like ```11:05:32PM```, convert it to 24h: ```23:05:32```.

Note that you must remove the AM/PM indicators.

Note also that 12 AM is 00:00:00.
